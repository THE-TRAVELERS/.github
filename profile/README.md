## What is TRAVELERS and what do we aim to ?

TRAVELERS is an annual student project carried out by students from [ESILV](https://esilv.fr). Launched in 2020 by Louis-Marie RESTOUT, Paul SORET, Matéo TOURON, Nicolas LEBOUCHER, and Hortense PLANTEAU DU MAROUSSEM, the project has been funded and is hosted by [DaVinciBot](https://www.davincibot.fr/), the robotics association of the Pôle Universitaire Léonard de Vinci.

The Travelers project aims to design a versatile and amphibious rover capable of exploring various terrestrial and aquatic environments. The primary goal is to develop a rover that can perform specific missions involving the collection and analysis of scientific samples, while being remotely operable. Travelers is also a technological demonstration project, aiming to showcase the capabilities of an all-terrain amphibious rover with a payload.
